* All the libraries other than Qt should be compiled as shared and installed to the system.
* It seems that it is easier to make things work by compiling Qt statically.
* Download the Qt source package and:

./configure -static -release -nomake examples -nomake tests -skip qtwebkit -skip qtwebkit-examples -opensource -confirm-license
sudo make -j4 install

* Run qmake and then make. Then run macdeployqt to copy needed shared libraries. Some symbolic links probably need to be created to make it find everything.
